## Feature Plan

*Replace this with your feature plan. Write a bit more detail under each heading from before (description, user, purpose). Also, add a fourth section to each with some technical notes on how you may implement each feature and any other backend or frontend notes you may need.*

### Feature 1: AI Trip Planner

**Description:** Users can utilize AI to generate a day-by-day, hourly itinerary. They may input any prompt about a destination they want to go to, how many days they are planning on staying, and information about what they would be interested in doing or what kind of traveler they are. The AI feature will output daily itinerary ideas in response according to what is popular and available for tourists, as well as ideas for places to eat if the user requests it. It should return in the format of day sections with bullet points of time slots and corresponding activities, with information on each activity.

**User(s):** This feature is important for users who don't like to do their own research and would like quick ideas on what to do day by day. It is also important for users who want to simplify their trip planning process, as all information and hourly itineraries can be generated for them on the spot. It allows ease of use and a better experience for users.

**Purpose:** This feature is significant for target users because it allows for easier trip planning when faced with an excess of information on things to do, what to see, etc, on the internet. This simplifies the whole process and makes gathering ideas on what to do much simpler for people already stressed out about travel plans. It also provides an easy method for lazy users or users who don't have the time or resources to spend hours scouring the internet or doing research to plan everything themselves.

**Technical Notes:** This feature will be implemented using our provided OpenAI key, which will be able to supply itinerary output as we direct it to. In the frontend, we have to create an AI-like messaging page that allows the user to type and send a message before getting a response from the model. Since we also want the user to be able to save itineraries generated from our AI, we have an itinerary table that can be joined with associated itinerary days and activities. This way, it can be saved to our DB as long as we can get the chat output to match our data model.

### Feature 2: Collaborative Itinerary Editing

**Description:** Users can collaborate with friends to build travel itineraries that have been generated by our AI trip planner or start from scratch. There will be a tab in our application where users can reach this collaborative editing and sharing interface with specific approved friends associated with this trip, as approved by the creator of the itinerary. Users can edit the itinerary document, and other collaborators will see these edits appear in real time as they are looking at the document too. Multiple users or collaborators can be looking at and editing an itinerary simultaneously. This feature will be similar to Google Docs functionality, but with a more stringent format to match our itinerary data model.

**User(s):** This feature is important for users who like to travel with and plan trips with their friends. It is for groups and individuals who want to be organized before or during their trip by ensuring everyone on their trip is on the same page and has access to the itinerary. It also gives everyone in the group an opportunity to give their input on activities to do on the trip. This feature can also be for a single traveler to edit his/her own itinerary in-app.

**Purpose:** This feature is significant for target users because it helps to keep everyone in the group organized and allows everyone to give their input as an itinerary is edited or created. Ideally, all travelers on a trip would have access to this itinerary to plan beforehand, look at throughout their trip, and change as needed before or during a trip. It is very convenient for the whole group to have the itinerary in-app and easily accessible at the touch of a button. 

**Technical Notes:** This feature will be implemented using Postgres changes as users edit the itinerary, with realtime changes synced to our DB so all users can see the most recent version of an itinerary. The presence realtime method can also be utilized to see which travelers are active on a document at any point in time. In the backend, we would need to utilize our itinerary table, itinerary days, and activities, as well as the itinerary collaborators and user profiles, to figure out which users are authorized to edit and collaborate on an itinerary. In the frontend, we would need to have an interface that looks like a text document, along with user profiles visible depending on who is actively viewing the document.
